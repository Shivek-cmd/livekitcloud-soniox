## Transcript

**SIERRA (greeting):** Hi! I'm Sierra, your virtual assistant. I speak English, Hindi, and Punjabi. How can I help you?

**USER:** Hi, one butter chicken please, medium.
> `add_item({"quantity": 1, "spice_level": "medium", "item_query": "butter chicken"})` → ADDED: 1 x Butter Chicken, note: medium. ⏎ ORDER NOW: 1 x Butter Chicken [medium]. total=$19.99 ⏎ GUIDE: confirm the add in the customer's language — warm and in your own words, never reading these lines aloud — using the exact dish name and quantity above (quantity spoken as "one", never a digit), then keep the order moving.
**SIERRA:** Sure thing — I've got one Butter Chicken, medium, down for you. Anything else I can get you with that?

**USER:** That's everything.
> `record_additional_requests({"response": "none"})` → ADDITIONAL REQUESTS RECORDED: none. ⏎ ORDER NOW: 1 x Butter Chicken [medium]. total=$19.99 ⏎ GUIDE: acknowledge warmly in the customer's language, in your own words — do NOT re-ask about spice or allergies — then keep the order moving (pickup or delivery next if not set yet).
**SIERRA:** Got it. Would you like to pick this up, or would you like us to deliver it for you?

**USER:** No allergies, nothing else.
**SIERRA:** Understood. And will this be for pickup or delivery?

**USER:** Pickup.
> `set_order_type({"order_type": "pickup"})` → Set to pickup. Continue the flow.
**SIERRA:** Great, that'll be for pickup. May I have your name for the order, please?

**USER:** Jasleen.
> `set_customer_contact({"name": "Jasleen"})` → NAME SAVED: "Jasleen". ⏎ GUIDE: confirm the name briefly in the customer's language. Then ask for their phone number.
**SIERRA:** Thanks, Jasleen. Could I please get a phone number for the order?

**USER:** Four one six five five five two two three three.
> `set_customer_contact({"phone": "4165552233"})` → PHONE SAVED: four, one, six, five, five, five, two, two, three, three. ⏎ GUIDE: the number is already saved — do NOT ask the customer to repeat or re-say it. Confirm it back once yourself, speaking it as English word digits exactly as in PHONE SAVED (never numerals, never Punjabi/Hindi number words), then continue the order.
> `get_order_readback({})` → READBACK FACTS — read ALL of these to the customer in their language, then ask if everything is correct: ⏎ - 1 x Butter Chicken [medium] ⏎ - order type: pickup (say "pickup" in English) ⏎ - name: Jasleen ⏎ GUIDE: phrase this warmly in your own words in the customer's language — but every item, its quantity (as a word, never a digit), and the order type must actually be spoken. Your spoken readback is checked — anything missing forces a re-read. End by asking if everything is correct.
**SIERRA:** Thanks, Jasleen. I have your phone number as four one six, five five five, two two three three. 

So, I have one Butter Chicken, medium, for pickup under the name Jasleen. Does that all look correct to you?

**USER (reactive):** Yes.
> `confirm_readback({})` → Read-back confirmed. Call place_order now.
> `place_order({})` → Order placed! INTERNAL total $19.99. Tell customer: "ਤੁਹਾਡਾ ਆਰਡਰ ਮਿਲ ਗਿਆ ਜੀ! 20-25 ਮਿੰਟ ਵਿੱਚ ਤਿਆਰ ਹੋ ਜਾਵੇਗਾ। ਬਹੁਤ ਬਹੁਤ ਧੰਨਵਾਦ ਜੀ!" Do NOT mention price or dollars.
**SIERRA:** ਤੁਹਾਡਾ ਆਰਡਰ ਮਿਲ ਗਿਆ ਜੀ! 20-25 ਮਿੰਟ ਵਿੱਚ ਤਿਆਰ ਹੋ ਜਾਵੇਗਾ। ਬਹੁਤ ਬਹੁਤ ਧੰਨਵਾਦ ਜੀ!

**USER:** Actually, add a garlic naan too.
> `add_item({"quantity": 1, "item_query": "garlic naan"})` → ADDED: 1 x ਗਾਰਲਿਕ ਨਾਨ (Garlic Naan). ⏎ ORDER NOW: 1 x Butter Chicken [medium]; 1 x ਗਾਰਲਿਕ ਨਾਨ (Garlic Naan). total=$24.98 ⏎ GUIDE: confirm the add in the customer's language — warm and in your own words, never reading these lines aloud — using the exact dish name and quantity above (quantity spoken as "one", never a digit), then keep the order moving.
**SIERRA:** Sure thing, I've added one Garlic Naan to your order. Since we've updated your order, let me just read everything back to you one more time to make sure it's all correct.

I have one Butter Chicken, medium, and one Garlic Naan, for pickup under the name Jasleen. Does that sound right?

**USER:** Yes, that's all correct now.
> `confirm_readback({})` → The order changed since the last read-back — call get_order_readback again and read the NEW version to the customer before confirming.
> `get_order_readback({})` → READBACK FACTS — read ALL of these to the customer in their language, then ask if everything is correct: ⏎ - 1 x Butter Chicken [medium] ⏎ - 1 x ਗਾਰਲਿਕ ਨਾਨ (Garlic Naan) ⏎ - order type: pickup (say "pickup" in English) ⏎ - name: Jasleen ⏎ GUIDE: phrase this warmly in your own words in the customer's language — but every item, its quantity (as a word, never a digit), and the order type must actually be spoken. Your spoken readback is checked — anything missing forces a re-read. End by asking if everything is correct.
**SIERRA:** Perfect. Just to be absolutely sure, I have one Butter Chicken, medium, and one Garlic Naan, for pickup under the name Jasleen. Is everything correct now?

**USER:** Yes, perfect.
> `confirm_readback({})` → Read-back confirmed. Call place_order now.
> `place_order({})` → ORDER COMPLETE — goodbye already spoken. Do NOT generate any assistant speech.
**SIERRA:**
