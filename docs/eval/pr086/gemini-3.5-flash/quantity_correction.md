## Transcript

**SIERRA (greeting):** Hi! I'm Sierra, your virtual assistant. I speak English, Hindi, and Punjabi. How can I help you?

**USER:** Two butter chicken please, medium spice.
> `add_item({"item_query": "butter chicken", "quantity": 2, "spice_level": "medium"})` → ADDED: 2 x Butter Chicken, note: medium. ⏎ ORDER NOW: 2 x Butter Chicken [medium]. total=$39.98 ⏎ GUIDE: confirm the add in the customer's language — warm and in your own words, never reading these lines aloud — using the exact dish name and quantity above (quantity spoken as "two", never a digit), then keep the order moving.
**SIERRA:** You got it — I've added two Butter Chicken with medium spice to your order. What else can I get started for you today?

**USER:** Wait — I said one, not two.
> `set_item_quantity({"quantity": 1, "item_query": "butter chicken"})` → CORRECTED (not added): Butter Chicken is now 1 total. ⏎ ORDER NOW: 1 x Butter Chicken [medium]. total=$19.99 ⏎ GUIDE: reassure the customer in their language, in your own words, that it is fixed — "one" total, not a second add.
**SIERRA:** Ah, my mistake! I've corrected that to just one Butter Chicken for you. What else would you like to add?

**USER:** That's all.
> `record_additional_requests({"response": "no"})` → ADDITIONAL REQUESTS RECORDED: none. ⏎ ORDER NOW: 1 x Butter Chicken [medium]. total=$19.99 ⏎ GUIDE: acknowledge warmly in the customer's language, in your own words — do NOT re-ask about spice or allergies — then keep the order moving (pickup or delivery next if not set yet).
**SIERRA:** Perfect. And will this order be for pickup or delivery today?

**USER:** No allergies, nothing else.
**SIERRA:** No problem, thank you for letting me know. Will this be for pickup or delivery?

**USER:** Pickup.
> `set_order_type({"order_type": "pickup"})` → Set to pickup. Continue the flow.
**SIERRA:** Got it, pickup it is. Can I get your name for the order, please?

**USER:** It's Simran.
> `set_customer_contact({"name": "Simran"})` → NAME SAVED: "Simran". ⏎ GUIDE: confirm the name briefly in the customer's language. Then ask for their phone number.
**SIERRA:** Thanks, Simran. And what is a good phone number to reach you at?

**USER:** Nine zero five five five five one one two two.
> `set_customer_contact({"phone": "9055551122"})` → PHONE SAVED: nine, zero, five, five, five, five, one, one, two, two. ⏎ GUIDE: the number is already saved — do NOT ask the customer to repeat or re-say it. Confirm it back once yourself, speaking it as English word digits exactly as in PHONE SAVED (never numerals, never Punjabi/Hindi number words), then continue the order.
> `get_order_readback({})` → READBACK FACTS — read ALL of these to the customer in their language, then ask if everything is correct: ⏎ - 1 x Butter Chicken [medium] ⏎ - order type: pickup (say "pickup" in English) ⏎ - name: Simran ⏎ GUIDE: phrase this warmly in your own words in the customer's language — but every item, its quantity (as a word, never a digit), and the order type must actually be spoken. Your spoken readback is checked — anything missing forces a re-read. End by asking if everything is correct.
**SIERRA:** Awesome, I've got that phone number down. Let me read your order back to make sure everything is correct: we have one Butter Chicken with medium spice for pickup under the name Simran. Does that all sound right to you?

**USER:** Yes, perfect.
> `confirm_readback({})` → Read-back confirmed. Call place_order now.
> `place_order({})` → Order placed! INTERNAL total $19.99. Tell customer: "ਤੁਹਾਡਾ ਆਰਡਰ ਮਿਲ ਗਿਆ ਜੀ! 20-25 ਮਿੰਟ ਵਿੱਚ ਤਿਆਰ ਹੋ ਜਾਵੇਗਾ। ਬਹੁਤ ਬਹੁਤ ਧੰਨਵਾਦ ਜੀ!" Do NOT mention price or dollars.
**SIERRA:** ਤੁਹਾਡਾ ਆਰਡਰ ਮਿਲ ਗਿਆ ਜੀ! 20-25 ਮਿੰਟ ਵਿੱਚ ਤਿਆਰ ਹੋ ਜਾਵੇਗਾ। ਬਹੁਤ ਬਹੁਤ ਧੰਨਵਾਦ ਜੀ!

**USER:** Yes.
**SIERRA:**
