## Transcript

**SIERRA (greeting):** Hi! I'm Sierra, your virtual assistant. I speak English, Hindi, and Punjabi. How can I help you?

**USER:** Hi, one butter chicken and one garlic naan please.
> `add_item({"quantity": 1, "item_query": "butter chicken"})` → ADDED: 1 x Butter Chicken. ⏎ ORDER NOW: 1 x Butter Chicken. total=$19.99 ⏎ GUIDE: confirm the add in the customer's language — warm and in your own words, never reading these lines aloud — using the exact dish name and quantity above (quantity spoken as "one", never a digit), then keep the order moving.
> `add_item({"item_query": "garlic naan", "quantity": 1})` → ADDED: 1 x ਗਾਰਲਿਕ ਨਾਨ (Garlic Naan). ⏎ ORDER NOW: 1 x Butter Chicken; 1 x ਗਾਰਲਿਕ ਨਾਨ (Garlic Naan). total=$24.98 ⏎ GUIDE: confirm the add in the customer's language — warm and in your own words, never reading these lines aloud — using the exact dish name and quantity above (quantity spoken as "one", never a digit), then keep the order moving.
**SIERRA:** You got it — I've added one Butter Chicken and one ਗਾਰਲਿਕ ਨਾਨ to your order. What else can I get started for you today?

**USER:** That's everything.
> `record_additional_requests({"response": "no"})` → ADDITIONAL REQUESTS RECORDED: none. ⏎ SPICE DEFAULTED: Butter Chicken set to medium (no preference stated — use set_item_spice if the customer actually named a level). ⏎ ORDER NOW: 1 x Butter Chicken [medium]; 1 x ਗਾਰਲਿਕ ਨਾਨ (Garlic Naan). total=$24.98 ⏎ GUIDE: acknowledge warmly in the customer's language, in your own words — do NOT re-ask about spice or allergies — then keep the order moving (pickup or delivery next if not set yet).
**SIERRA:** Perfect. And will this order be for pickup, or would you like us to deliver it to you?

**USER:** No, nothing — all good.
**SIERRA:** No problem. Will you be coming by to pick this up, or would you like us to deliver it to your place?

**USER:** Pickup.
> `set_order_type({"order_type": "pickup"})` → Set to pickup. Continue the flow.
**SIERRA:** Awesome, pickup it is. May I please have your name for the order?

**USER:** My name is Karan.
> `set_customer_contact({"name": "Karan"})` → NAME SAVED: "Karan". ⏎ GUIDE: confirm the name briefly in the customer's language. Then ask for their phone number.
**SIERRA:** Thanks, Karan. And what is a good phone number to reach you at?

**USER:** Four one six five five five one two three four.
> `set_customer_contact({"phone": "4165551234"})` → PHONE SAVED: four, one, six, five, five, five, one, two, three, four. ⏎ GUIDE: the number is already saved — do NOT ask the customer to repeat or re-say it. Confirm it back once yourself, speaking it as English word digits exactly as in PHONE SAVED (never numerals, never Punjabi/Hindi number words), then continue the order.
> `get_order_readback({})` → READBACK FACTS — read ALL of these to the customer in their language, then ask if everything is correct: ⏎ - 1 x Butter Chicken [medium] ⏎ - 1 x ਗਾਰਲਿਕ ਨਾਨ (Garlic Naan) ⏎ - order type: pickup (say "pickup" in English) ⏎ - name: Karan ⏎ GUIDE: phrase this warmly in your own words in the customer's language — but every item, its quantity (as a word, never a digit), and the order type must actually be spoken. Your spoken readback is checked — anything missing forces a re-read. End by asking if everything is correct.
**SIERRA:** Got that down as four, one, six, five, five, five, one, two, three, four. 

Alright, let's make sure I've got everything right: I have one Butter Chicken and one ਗਾਰਲਿਕ ਨਾਨ for pickup under the name Karan. Is all of that correct?

**USER (reactive):** Yes.
> `confirm_readback({})` → Read-back confirmed. Call place_order now.
> `place_order({})` → Order placed! INTERNAL total $24.979999999999997. Tell customer: "ਤੁਹਾਡਾ ਆਰਡਰ ਮਿਲ ਗਿਆ ਜੀ! 20-25 ਮਿੰਟ ਵਿੱਚ ਤਿਆਰ ਹੋ ਜਾਵੇਗਾ। ਬਹੁਤ ਬਹੁਤ ਧੰਨਵਾਦ ਜੀ!" Do NOT mention price or dollars.
**SIERRA:** ਤੁਹਾਡਾ ਆਰਡਰ ਮਿਲ ਗਿਆ ਜੀ! 20-25 ਮਿੰਟ ਵਿੱਚ ਤਿਆਰ ਹੋ ਜਾਵੇਗਾ। ਬਹੁਤ ਬਹੁਤ ਧੰਨਵਾਦ ਜੀ!

**USER:** Yes, that's right.
**SIERRA:**
