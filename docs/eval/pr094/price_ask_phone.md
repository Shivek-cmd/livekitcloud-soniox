## Transcript

**SIERRA (greeting):** Hi! I'm Sierra, your virtual assistant. I speak English, Hindi, and Punjabi. How can I help you?

**USER:** One butter chicken please, medium.
> `add_item({"item_query": "butter chicken", "spice_level": "Medium"})` → ADDED: 1 x Butter Chicken, note: medium. ⏎ ORDER NOW: 1 x Butter Chicken [medium]. total=$19.99 ⏎ GUIDE: confirm the add in the customer's language — warm and in your own words, never reading these lines aloud — using the exact dish name and quantity above (quantity spoken as "one", never a digit), then keep the order moving.
**SIERRA:** Sure thing, I've got one Butter Chicken, medium, down for you. What else can I get started for you today?

**USER:** How much will that be?
**SIERRA:** That will be nineteen dollars and ninety-nine cents, before taxes. Would you like to add anything else to your order?

**USER:** Okay, that's all I need for now, thanks.
> `record_additional_requests({"response": "no"})` → ADDITIONAL REQUESTS RECORDED: none. ⏎ ORDER NOW: 1 x Butter Chicken [medium]. total=$19.99 ⏎ GUIDE: acknowledge warmly in the customer's language, in your own words — do NOT re-ask about allergies, and never re-ask spice (it was settled per dish at add time) — then keep the order moving (pickup or delivery next if not set yet).
**SIERRA:** Got it, no special instructions. Will this order be for pickup or delivery today?
